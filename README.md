# Zora Neale Hurston API
### This api represents all the works written by Zora Neale Hurston, one of my favorites!
## Model Schema
### The parent model schema of this API includes a title, type of work such as book or anthology, and date published
## CRUD
### The user of this API will be able to create a new Hurston document, add it to the collection, show all documents, update a document if information researched is incorrect, and delete a document

## TOOLS
#### I built this API using POSTMAN software. 

## Icebox
#### I would love to collaborate with others to make this a real wiki-like project including models about the writer, subject matter featured in each work, cover image urls, update the model to include additional contributors,especially a non-fiction work, and information about the publisher.
